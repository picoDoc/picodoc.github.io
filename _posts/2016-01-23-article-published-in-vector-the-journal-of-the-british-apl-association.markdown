Myself and the talented Mr. Paul Loughran recently had an [article published in APL](http://archive.vector.org.uk/art10501600).  It's turned out to be strangely topical (considering we wrote it 6 months ago!) with Buzzfeed and the BBC publishing an expose last week on [match fixing in professional tennis](https://www.buzzfeed.com/heidiblake/the-tennis-racket), where one of the main pieces of evidence is betting odds movements before games.

Head over there and check it out!
