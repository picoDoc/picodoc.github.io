<p>Myself and the talented Mr. Paul Loughran recently had an <a href="http://archive.vector.org.uk/art10501600" target="_blank">article published in APL</a>.  It's turned out to be strangely topical (considering we wrote it 6 months ago!) with Buzzfeed and the BBC publishing an expose last week on <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/heidiblake/the-tennis-racket" target="_blank">match fixing in professional tennis</a>, where one of the main pieces of evidence is betting odds movements before games.</p>
<p>Head over there and check it out!</p>
