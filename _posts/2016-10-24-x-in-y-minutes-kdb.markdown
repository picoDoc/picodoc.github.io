No programming language is an island. When working on a large system it can be very useful – and sometimes necessary – to gain some knowledge outside of your area of expertise; preferably without investing a lot of time wading through tutorials explaining how a for loop works, or the difference between if and if-else.

Adam Bard started up [X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/) a few years ago dedicated to short intros to languages, written in-line as code and intended to get experienced programmers up to speed with the syntax of a language quickly. I’ve added a [section on kdb+](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/kdb+/), which will hopefully be useful to those looking to become productive in kdb+ quickly without investing a significant amount of time.
