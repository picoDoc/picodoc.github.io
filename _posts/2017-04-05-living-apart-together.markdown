The UK's recent decision to leave the European Union and the recent snap assembly election has coincided with a renewed focus on demographic shifts in Northern Ireland.  I've had the pleasure of working on a [mapping project](https://www.thedetail.tv/articles/data-mapping-shows-northern-ireland-s-divisions-haven-t-gone-away) with [the detail](https://www.thedetail.tv/) and [The Irish Times](https://www.irishtimes.com/), looking at how - despite the progress that's been made in the peace process - the two communities in Northern Ireland still live apart.

Paul Nolan's article covered in both [the Irish Times](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/two-tribes-a-divided-northern-ireland-1.3030921) and in full on [the detail](https://www.thedetail.tv/articles/northern-ireland-living-apart-together) as part of this project is a really great read.

The full interactive maps can be found [here](https://www.thedetail.tv/mapfiles/).
