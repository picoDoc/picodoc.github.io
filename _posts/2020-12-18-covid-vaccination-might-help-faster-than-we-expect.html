<p>So great news, we have a vaccine! and it's seems to be <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4826" target="_blank">really good</a>!  Although broad vaccination of everyone who wants one is going to take quite a while, vaccination is going to help much faster than you might expect, because we can target the most vulnerable groups first. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Let's make a really simple model, where we assume:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>COVID fatality rates by age will stay roughly the same as they have been (I'm using the Wales and England data)</li>
<li>The vaccine is <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4826">95% effective</a> at preventing COVID fatalities</li>
<li>It takes 3 weeks from initial vaccination to provide this protection</li>
<li>We prioritize vaccination based on age alone (oldest first)</li>
<li>The current rate of vaccination is that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-55360646" target="_blank">reported for Northern Ireland</a> yesterday (around 10,000 people in 9 days)</li>
<li>We ramp up the vaccination rate over the next 2 months to about 5 times that (if we want to have half of people vaccinated by summer this is the kind of rate we have to aim for)</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With these assumptions we get something that looks like:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":1658,"sizeSlug":"large"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2020/12/vaccinations-1024x373.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1658" /></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So based on these numbers we could expect to see:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>A 50% reduction in deaths - relative to without a vaccine - by the end of January</li>
<li>An almost 80% reduction by the start of March</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I've attached my model <a href="https://www.picodoc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vaccination-model.xlsx">here</a> for anyone interested in playing with the numbers. The big caveat here is I'm talking about a reduction in deaths relative to no vaccinations. If for example we reduce deaths by 50%, but twice as many people get infected, we'll be in the same place. It's also obviously still key to vaccinate a much larger number of people to try to achieve herd immunity and truly get our lives back to normal, but as you can see even 15-20% vaccination rates should make a huge difference, as the risks from COVID increase so dramatically with age.  Roll on the vaccine!</p>
