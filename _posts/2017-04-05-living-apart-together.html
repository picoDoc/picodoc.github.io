<p>The UK's recent decision to leave the European Union and the recent snap assembly election has coincided with a renewed focus on demographic shifts in Northern Ireland.  I've had the pleasure of working on a <a href="https://www.thedetail.tv/articles/data-mapping-shows-northern-ireland-s-divisions-haven-t-gone-away" target="_blank">mapping project</a> with <a href="https://www.thedetail.tv/" target="_blank">the detail</a> and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/" target="_blank">the Irish Times</a>, looking at how - despite the progress that's been made in the peace process - the two communities in Northern Ireland still live apart.</p>

<p>Paul Nolan's article covered in both <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/two-tribes-a-divided-northern-ireland-1.3030921" target="_blank">the Irish Times</a> and in full on <a href="https://www.thedetail.tv/articles/northern-ireland-living-apart-together" target="_blank">the detail</a> as part of this project is a really great read.</p>
<p>The full interactive maps can be found <a href="https://www.thedetail.tv/mapfiles/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
