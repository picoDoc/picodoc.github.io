So great news, we have a vaccine! and it's seems to be [really good](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4826)!  Although broad vaccination of everyone who wants one is going to take quite a while, vaccination is going to help much faster than you might expect, because we can target the most vulnerable groups first.

Let's make a really simple model, where we assume:

* COVID fatality rates by age will stay roughly the same as they have been (I'm using the Wales and England data)
* The vaccine is [95% effective](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4826) at preventing COVID fatalities
* It takes 3 weeks from initial vaccination to provide this protection
* We prioritize vaccination based on age alone (oldest first)
* The current rate of vaccination is that [reported for Northern Ireland](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-55360646) yesterday (around 10,000 people in 9 days)
* We ramp up the vaccination rate over the next 2 months to about 5 times that (if we want to have half of people vaccinated by summer this is the kind of rate we have to aim for)
<

With these assumptions we get something that looks like:

So based on these numbers we could expect to see:

* A 50% reduction in deaths - relative to without a vaccine - by the end of January
* An almost 80% reduction by the start of March

I've attached my model [here](/assets/2020/12/vaccination-model.xlsx) for anyone interested in playing with the numbers. The big caveat here is I'm talking about a reduction in deaths relative to no vaccinations. If for example we reduce deaths by 50%, but twice as many people get infected, we'll be in the same place. It's also obviously still key to vaccinate a much larger number of people to try to achieve herd immunity and truly get our lives back to normal, but as you can see even 15-20% vaccination rates should make a huge difference, as the risks from COVID increase so dramatically with age.  Roll on the vaccine!
